  ## Description:
  This project is a open source Mark Down Generator.  It allows the user to quickly and easily input README.md information within terminal and command line.  This allows the user to save time writing a README.md file so that they can spend more time writing code.  The motivation for this project is to save time in the future so that README.md files are easier to complete so that I can spend more time on a project.  This generator will continue to be refined so that it can be used by others and especially myself.  The importance of a great README.md is one that will make a website stick out from others and shine.
